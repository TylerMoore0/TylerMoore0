# Tyler Moore
Hey! I’m **Tyler** I am a student currently pursuing an advanced diploma at St Lawrence College's Computer Programming and Analysis program. I'm capable of both front-end and back-end development and don’t have a particular preference because I find both are enjoyable. I’m always eager to improve my skillset and sharpen my knowledge to develop better and more efficient programs.
